# ðŸ¦€ Learning Rust

This repository contains multiple Rust projects, created as part of my journey to learn and master the Rust programming language.

## Structure

Each subdirectory in this repo is a standalone Rust project:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ guessing_game/
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

To run one of the projects:

```bash
cd project_name
cargo run
```
